# 🤖 AI Chatbot using Streamlit, LangChain & Google Gemini

Welcome to the **AI Chatbot Project**, an interactive conversational assistant built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Google Gemini Generative AI**.  
This project demonstrates how large language models can be integrated with modern UI frameworks to create a real-time chatbot capable of understanding user queries, generating meaningful responses, and preserving conversation history within a session.

The chatbot simulates natural conversation by tracking user interactions and giving context-aware answers. With the power of Gemini models and LangChain’s history management, users experience smooth and continuous chat similar to real messaging applications.  
This project is ideal for developers, students, and AI enthusiasts exploring **Generative AI, chatbots, prompt engineering**, and **web-based conversational applications**.
